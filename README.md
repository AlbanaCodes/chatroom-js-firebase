This is a project based on this [project](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/modern-javascript/tree/lesson-136/chat_project)

In my version I will use the firebase version 9 and made some other small changes.

Some of the differences and things to keep in mind:
  - use config file to store the configuration strings for firestore.
  - config.js will not be tracked for changes because of the firestore credentials
